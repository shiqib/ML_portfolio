# Shiqi's Machine Learning Portfolio
# These are some of machine learning project that I have finished.
# [Project 1: Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://github.com/PlayingNumbers/ds_salary_proj) 
* Created a tool that estimates data science salaries (MAE ~ $ 11K) to help data scientists negotiate their income when they get a job.
* Scraped over 1000 job descriptions from glassdoor using python and selenium
* Engineered features from the text of each job description to quantify the value companies put on python, excel, aws, and spark. 
* Optimized Linear, Lasso, and Random Forest Regressors using GridsearchCV to reach the best model. 
* Built a client facing API using flask
