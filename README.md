# Shiqi's Machine Learning Portfolio
# Here are some of machine learning project that I have finished.
# [Project 1: Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://github.com/PlayingNumbers/ds_salary_proj) 
* Implemented 5 machine learning classifiers using Scikit-learn to detect credit card fraud, which achieved 0.98 AUC score. 
* Visualized and preprocessed unbalanced 280,000+ credit card data based on correlation plot and ANOVA score.

# [Project 2: Netflix Recommendation Systems](https://github.com/PlayingNumbers/ds_salary_proj) 
* Implemented content-based filtering and collaborative filtering model(SVD matrix factorization) in Python to recommend Movies.
* Analyzed the ratings, genres and duration of movies, and visualized 2GB movies and TV shows data using Seaborn.

# [Project 3: Sentiment Analysis on Amazon Food Reviews](https://github.com/PlayingNumbers/ds_salary_proj) 
* Implemented sentimental analysis models using VADER and pretrained model from huggingface on 500,000+ Amazon food Reviews from Oct 1999 to Oct 2012.

# [Project 4: Fake News Detection](https://github.com/PlayingNumbers/ds_salary_proj) 
* Implemented a recurrent neural network model using TensorFlow to detect fake news, which achieved an accuracy of 0.99, precision of 0.98 and recall of 0.99.
